Description: Can be used for simulation of organisms living in
    communities. Each organism is represented individually and genome scale
    metabolic models determine the uptake and release of compounds. Biological
    processes such as movement, diffusion, chemotaxis and kinetics are available
    along with data analysis techniques.
